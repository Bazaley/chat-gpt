    <h2>ChatGPT does not give effective results to everyone WHY? 🤔</h2>

    <p>
      📉 Limited training data: ChatGPT's ability to generate text is heavily
      reliant on the quality and quantity of training data it receives.
    </p>

    <p>
      🤷‍♂️ Ambiguity in language: Language is inherently ambiguous, and ChatGPT's
      interpretation of a prompt can be influenced by the ambiguity of language.
    </p>

    <p>
      🧠 Lack of domain knowledge: ChatGPT has a vast knowledge base, but it may
      not always have specific domain knowledge that is relevant to a marketer's
      needs.
